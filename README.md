# heroku-smartoilgauge

I've got a Smart Oil Gauge and, unfortunately, their API costs money. 

Fortunately, it's not too hard to scrape the information from their website so that it can be used in HomeAssistant or a number of other places.

I've got a small Raspberry Pi that is located by my oil tank, in the basement, and it's neat to be able to see the remaining gallons available.

Instead of using a script on there, I wanted to brush-up on my Selenium, Python and Heroku skills to develop an app 
that could be tested in my IDE on Windows and also deployed onto Heroku so that I could run a very simple script that calls out to grab the gallons remaining.
